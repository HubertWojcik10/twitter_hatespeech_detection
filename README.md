# First Year Project (Twitter Hatespeech Detection)
### A 3rd group project during my 2nd semester at the IT University of Copenhagen.

Our main task was to create a classifier that predicts whether a given tweet is hate speech or not. We were introduced to the core concepts of Natural Language Processing. We learned how to prepare text data for automatic processing, how to annotate data for supervised classification, and how to train and run a classifier for a basic NLP task. I have worked on every part of the project, but the most time I spent on trying different techniques of preparing our data before classification (tokenizers, word corrections, removing stop words, etc.).
